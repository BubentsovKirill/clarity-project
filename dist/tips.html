        <div class="trips-text">
            <p>Finding the kind of love that lasts a lifetime online is not only possible, but likely.
                dating.clarity-project.net works hard to deliver you the most compatible matches possible. We believe in
                empowering you to make the best choices by providing guidance and support to help you discover your best
                qualities and those of your potential partners throughout your search.
            </p>
            <p>As with anyone you meet online or offline, your sound judgment and instincts are necessary to protect
                yourself. There is no substitution for acting with caution when communicating with someone you are just
                getting to know. Here are some essential 'rules-of-the-road' for safely navigating any relationship, but
                especially one that begins online.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Always Use Your Best Judgment</b>
                    <p>1.1. While dating.clarity-project.net routinely monitors account activity and investigates all
                        complaints of unusual, inappropriate or falsified accounts, dating.clarity-project.net does not
                        conduct criminal background checks at the time an account is registered. As with any personal
                        interaction, keep in mind it is always possible for people to misrepresent themselves. Assessing
                        a match's truthfulness and honesty is ultimately your responsibility. Don't ignore any facts that
                        seem inconsistent or "off." Trust your instincts and remember that you have control over the situation.
                        If you're talking to someone online or by phone and they say things that raise your suspicions,
                        consider ending the conversation. If you’re out on a date and you feel uncomfortable, leave.
                    </p>
                    <p>1.2. Also, be aware of these common red flags when you’re getting to know someone new. Watch out
                        for someone who:
                    </p>
                    <p>1.2.1. Immediately requests to talk or chat on an outside email or messaging service;</p>
                    <p>1.2.2. Claims that your introduction was “destiny” or “fate,” especially early in communication;</p>
                    <p>1.2.3. Asks for money, goods or any similar type of assistance, especially if you have never met in person;</p>
                    <p>1.2.4. Asks you to assist with personal transactions (depositing funds, shipping merchandise, etc);</p>
                    <p>1.2.5. Wants the relationship to progress faster than you are comfortable going;</p>
                    <p>1.2.6. Reports a sudden personal crisis and pressures you to provide financial assistance. Be especially
                        wary if the person’s demands become increasingly aggressive;</p>
                    <p>1.2.7. Asks in appropriate questions;</p>
                    <p>1.2.8. Requests your home or work address under the guise of sending flowers or gifts;</p>
                    <p>1.2.9. Tells inconsistent or grandiose stories;</p>
                    <p>1.2.10. Gives vague answers to specific questions;</p>
                    <p>1.2.11. Urges you to compromise your principles;</p>
                    <p>1.2.12. Constantly blames others for troubles in his or her life;</p>
                    <p>1.2.13. Insists on getting overly close, very fast;</p>
                    <p>1.2.14. Claims to be recently widowed;</p>
                    <p>1.2.15. Disappears suddenly from the site then reappears under a different name;</p>
                </li>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">If a match does any of the above activities or makes you suspicious in any other way, please report
                    about this profile to <b>support@dating.clarity-project.net</b> so that we can investigate the matter.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <b>Never share financial information or certain personal information</b>
                    <p>2.1. Never give out your credit card number or bank information.</p>
                    <p>2.2. Never share your Social Security Number, mother's maiden name, or other private information
                        that can be used to access your financial information.</p>
                    <p>2.3. Never send money to someone you meet online, especially by wire transfer.</p>
                </li>
                <p>Immediately stop communicating with anyone who pressures you for personal or financial information or
                    attempts in any way to trick you into revealing it.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <b>Protect your account</b>
                    <p>3.1. When accessing your account from a public or shared computer, use caution and be aware of your
                        surroundings so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Be Cautious When Sharing Personal Information</b>
                    <p>4.1. We strongly encourage you to be cautious when sharing personal information that could reveal
                        your identity. Never include your last name, email address, home address, telephone number, place
                        of work or any other identifying information in your Internet profile or initial email messages.
                        Take full advantage of our secure and completely anonymous Guided Communication process, and resist
                        the urge to provide a personal email or phone number right away, no matter how strong a connection
                        to your match may feel. Once you've given out personal information, you cannot take it back! We
                        encourage you to get to know a match well via our secure dating.clarity-project.net Mail system
                        before taking the next step and sharing a telephone number, instant messenger handle or email address.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.2. Phoning with the other person is an important step in getting to know each other better. But
                        before you share phone numbers, make sure you have discussed the need to respect each other's
                        privacy. If either of you decide to end communication in the future, agree not to use the phone
                        number as a means to pursue an unwanted relationship. For added security, try using your phone's
                        privacy features when you call, like private number blocking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Do your own research</b>
                    <p>5.1. While we conduct certain types of screening and utilize a variety of screening technologies
                        and resources, such as screening our subscribers against public sex offender registries in the
                        World, it is important to remember that such screenings are inherently limited. Registries can
                        be incomplete or inaccurate, and states and jurisdictions differ as to what type of crime must
                        be registered on their registries and what types of crimes get removed. Many crimes often go
                        unreported and perpetrators are not always convicted. Relying solely on screening can provide a
                        false sense of security, so we strongly recommend that you follow the rest of the Safety Tips
                        regardless of any screenings that we may perform. When it comes to your personal safety, you are
                        in ultimate control.</p>
                    <p>5.2. It is also important to note that our optional identity verification service is not a background
                        check. We rely on the honesty of our members when filling out our dating.clarity-project.net
                        Relationship Questionnaire to supply us with their correct date of birth, marital status, city
                        and state of residence, occupation, educational background and other information.
                    </p>
                    <p>5.3. Regardless of the connection you feel with any of your matches, we encourage you to do your
                        own research before meeting in person. This can include typing your match's name into a search
                        engine, contacting your state or local municipalities to obtain public information, or using a
                        paid service to obtain a full background report. Above all else, use common sense. Pay attention
                        to the details someone shares with you. If you find anything that doesn't seem to add up, follow
                        your intuition and stop communicating with that person.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Use caution when deciding to click on any URL link</b>
                    <p>6.1. We understand that a site may share a URL link to a favorite website or article as part of
                        the get-to-know-you communication process. However, as a general practice, you should always use
                        good judgment and be cautious when deciding to click on any URL links. Use of these links to
                        access other Internet sites is at your own risk.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Take your time</b>
                    <p>7.1. While online communication can accelerate one's sense of comfort and intimacy, we can't stress
                        enough how important it is for you to take your time getting to know your match. We encourage you
                        to use dating.clarity-project.net anonymous Mail system as long as necessary to find out as much
                        about your match as is reasonably possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>7.2. Even though dating.clarity-project.net creates extremely compatible matches, compatibility
                        alone does not replace the need for real-life experience. It is vital to date and get to know
                        each other in a deep, revealing and meaningful way by sharing a broad base of experiences together.
                        The more experiences you share, the better your chances of avoiding hidden and sometimes unpleasant
                        surprises. So allow time for a variety of experiences to occur, particularly your everyday routines.
                        In cases of long-distance relationships, if possible, you should consider living in the same area
                        for a significant time before committing to a more serious relationship. Move slowly and pay
                        attention to the reality of your new relationship.

                <li>
                    <b>Make your first date safe and successful?</b>
                    <p>Meeting in person is exciting. Have fun and explore the level of chemistry you share with your
                        date, but don't let high hopes cloud your ability to exercise reasonable caution.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
                        <b>Do:</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>8.1. Choose the time and place of your date wisely. Meet in a public place at a decent hour during
                        which lots of people will be around. Lunch dates work especially well.</p>
                    <p>8.2. Limit alcohol consumption or abstain entirely until you know the person better.</p>
                    <p>8.3. Use your own transportation, even when meeting someone who lives a great distance away from
                        you. Never agree to be picked up at your home. It's never a good idea to get into someone's
                        personal vehicle on a first date. Wherever possible, drive yourself or take a taxi.</p>
                    <p>8.4. Tell at least one friend or family member about your plans and when you will return. Arrange
                        to check in with them after each of the first few dates</p>
                    <p>8.5. Carry a fully charged mobile phone with easily accessible emergency numbers.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
                        <b>Don't:</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>8.6. Leave unattended personal belongings such as purses, wallets, or jackets with pockets that
                        may contain items that could reveal personal information about you, such as a driver's license,
                        credit cards and ATM receipts.</p>
                    <p>8.7. Meet at your house or place of work or give that information out until you have had a good
                        opportunity to know the other person better.</p>
                    <p>8.8. Incur large expenses on a date without first discussing how the cost will be divided.</p>
                    <p>8.9. Go home with someone, even if it feels like everything is going great. You have not spent
                        enough time with them to assess whether your safety is at risk.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Always be respectful and kind</b>
                    <p>9.1. Always be respectful and treat your matches as you would want them to treat you. Not every
                        match is going to be right for you so closing communication with matches and having matches close
                        communication with you is a natural and healthy part of the process. dating.clarity-project.net
                        is about bringing two compatible people together who have a solid foundation from which a
                        long-term relationship would have a high probability of success. You still need to carefully
                        consider whether this particular person is one with whom you would like to further a relationship.
                        If you feel the need to end communication, then be honest, direct and polite. The sooner you
                        address this determination, the better for both of you.
                    </p>
                    <p>9.2. If a match feels the need to close communication with you, please respect their wishes.</p>
